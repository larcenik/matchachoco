Today, I started to bite the bullet and finally learn how to make websites after a decade of yearning. I used to want to be *that* tumblr girl who knew how to make themes but never really got around to it. Well, I've just decided today is that day!

Why did I decide to learn web development? Simple. **I missed being creative**. This is just my way of being that while taking a break from using my pen and paper, hehe.

## Accomplishments

<mark>Reviewed HTML/CSS:</mark> First I coded my website from scratch to get a gist of the basics again. (Tough work!)

<mark>Made Pixel Art:</mark> Not only did I want to make a website, I wanted to make *sozai* so people could take some and use for their own websites to look cute. I have yet to release them but one of these days I will!

<mark>Learning about iframes:</mark> I snooped around neocities and it seems to be common to use iframes to craft pages. I really want to learn other ways to make pages without going crazy, haha. Surely there is another way...? <span class="mikiyu">(;v;)</span>
