So I caved and just learned a static site generator, haha. I learned more about iframes and decided it just wasn't worth the hassle and there were safer solutions to my problems.

Introducing Astro! I see a lot of people on neocities using Eleventy, Hugo, Jekyll, all sorts of other SSGs. Why did I choose Astro? I simply decided that if I was going to learn an SSG I might as well learn one that is easy, fast, and modern. It's gotten a lot of good rep from my impression of the <a href="">State of JS 2024 Survey</a>, which goes to show that the framework has a largely positive following around it. I was sold!

I followed the starter blog tutorial to construct this site, but there's still a lot I could learn to do better still. I understand better how it works at least, but I want a blog that has pagination, a sequentially linked blog, and a content collection that allows me to code shrines.

This is kind of getting addicting actually. Not only am I thinking about learning more about web development, why not software development? Game development? So many possibilities!!! <span class='mikiyu'>(&starf;â–½&starf;)</span>
